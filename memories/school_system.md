From the perspective of the Gerrman school system.

In the German school system, investments in the billions were not made.
Dilapidated school buildings need urgent renovation.

Every German federal state has it's own laws regading education, 
which makes it complicated having a uniform way of learning new things.

It is not so bad, as it sounds, but I think that the pupils need some 
assistance from the people.

I could imagine an independent organization that would provide all 
students with additional educational opportunities.
