# German school system

From the perspective of the Gerrman school system.

In the German school system, investments in the billions were not made.
Dilapidated school buildings need urgent renovation.

Every German federal state has it's own laws regading education, 
which makes it complicated having a uniform way of learning new things.

It is not so bad, as it sounds, but I think that the pupils need some 
assistance from the people.

I could imagine an independent organization that would provide all 
students with additional educational opportunities.

## public schools 2019/2020

| Kind           | count        |

# how to start?

For a first start you can set up a GitLab like instance to write down some `stories`.
Having these stories, create `tasks` for a development team.

A team can look like (eg. for a scrum process)

* a `scrum master`
* a `product owner`
* two `frontend guys`
* two `backend guys`
* one **dedicated** `devops/dba` guy

## some thoughts

* These numbers are nearly constant over years, so you can build a system with a predictable work load.
* You have an update window on weekends, because there are no courses.
