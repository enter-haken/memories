Using Azure:

> Setting Up A Cloud Gaming VM

> Like for many others, my first contact to computers was related to playing computer games. I still like to play computer games from time to time - but the purchase of a real gaming computer seems to be overkill for playing 10 to 20 hours a year.

> Using cloud technologies in day-to-day business, the obvious solution is to create a virtual machine (VM) hosted in the cloud. This VM can then be used as a remote desktop, which runs the games you would like to play. I had no worries related to RAM or CPU, but I was a bit sceptic with regard to latency. After some research I was convinced, that there is good chance that it will work and tried it out.

> This blog post is intended as documentation of the setup. Feel free to adopt it for your gaming needs. I will use Microsoft Azure as the public cloud provider. Basic knowledge about Microsoft Azure is necessary, because the explanation is mainly focussed on the pitfalls I came across.

Maybe an other RDP protocol...

> NICE DCV

> Deliver high-performance remote desktop and application streaming

> NICE DCV is a high-performance remote display protocol that provides customers with a secure way to deliver remote desktops and application streaming from any cloud or data center to any device, over varying network conditions. With NICE DCV and Amazon EC2, customers can run graphics-intensive applications remotely on EC2 instances, and stream their user interface to simpler client machines, eliminating the need for expensive dedicated workstations. Customers across a broad range of HPC workloads use NICE DCV for their remote visualization requirements. The NICE DCV streaming protocol is also utilized by popular services, like Amazon Appstream 2.0, AWS Nimble Studio, and AWS RoboMaker.

A little bit older... 2015

> Revised and much faster, run your own high-end cloud gaming service on EC2!
