>  Almost all successful businesses start by tackling problems that have popular, pre-existing, alternative solutions.

> If people are already using solutions, that's proof the problem is real.

> It's actually harder to sell cheap things, because people care less. I've bought more cars than back scratchers in my life. This is true even if you're a small, scrappy startup. I've met 2-person teams selling their software for $10,000 per year per customer. Pick a high-value problem and charge a high price.

> For example, if I was solving a problem for software engineers, I'd be looking at GitHub, SEO (developers do tons of Google searches), Hacker News, conferences, code-related newsletters and podcasts and YouTube channels and communities, Twitter influencers, bootcamps, etc. These are all potential channels.

> Don't just copy what competitors are doing. Yes, I advised you to pick a straightforward, proven problem. But don't default to that with your solution.

> This is the essence of product-market fit: tailoring your product specifically to your customers' needs. You want to make it such a good fit for these specific people that it's a no-brainer for them to use it. Stripe, for example, knew its target customers were developers, so they focused heavily on great API design and stellar documentation. This is the kind of advantage you can only get if you've identified a customer and their problems before you started on the solution. Otherwise you'll build something generic.

> Finding fewer customers means you'll grow faster, too. Charging $250/month vs $5/mo is the difference between finding 40 customers and 2000 customers. Finding 40 customers is waaayyyyy faster. 2000 customers might take years.

> Qualitatively, customers care more about valuable problems, so it's just an easier sell. You don't have to convince a company that it should grow its revenue.

> Some think: "It'll be easier to sell things if my product is cheap." Rarely the case, because as I mentioned above, cheap = not valuable = people don't care.

> Most valuable problems have been discovered already.

> Most unsolved problems are unsolved because they aren't valuable to solve.

> Generally, most "innovative" ideas are solving old, boring, tried-and-true problems in a new way, due to new research, or new technology platforms, new trends, new customers entering the market, etc.

> It's better to think: "Let me pick some problem that's proven to be valuable as evidenced by the fact that people/companies are paying a lot to solve it. Then I'll dig into customers' needs to find out what they don't like about existing solutions, or what niche isn't best-served by existing solutions. Then I'll build something extremely specific to that set of needs, so for people who have those needs, I'm the only real solution."
