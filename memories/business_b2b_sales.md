* identify your customer
  * focus on one industry

There are three main things we try to learn from early calls:

    1. the problem that your customers are facing (and how you might solve it)
    2. how they're currently solving it (if they are)
    3. how big of a problem it is
```

Maybe you see a problem, which will apear in a year or so, which is currently not so important.

For example

```
Important changes to our server and Data Center products

```

Who is currently using Jira on their own servers?
Who is willing do pay for a selfhosted solution?

Atlassian is a big company.
Maybe the on promise sales have a to big overhead, so they are getting to less money out of it.
Maybe they want to get on the subscribtion train.
Even this is targeting only a small part there customers, this is still a million worth in sales.
