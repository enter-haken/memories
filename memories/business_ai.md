What business products make sense?

This comes from [tara.ai][1]:

```
Why are you free?

Most project management software is stuck in the early 2000â€™s and caps at 10 users for free accounts - we created Tara to power a paradigm shift in project management. Our free forever plan has unlimited tasks, sprints and workspaces, with no user limits.

Are there any contracts or trials?

Like our software, we keep things simple. No trials, contracts or hidden fees. Just run your sprints and weekly priorities in a few clicks.

How will you stay in business?

We are working on functionality for teams that provides visibility and predictability in product development. Features may include automation around sprints and multi-team workflows. This will be part of our premium plan, and is where the AI comes into play.
```

I don't know, if this works without venture capital.
The AI part must be good enought to open the customers pocket.
