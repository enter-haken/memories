There are some parallels from remote learning to remote work.

When you have an on site course in your school, a teacher is 
working with blackboards and worksheets.

Since Covid19, remote learning becomes more and more important.
You should not rely on the solutions, provided by the industry.
This is because the processed data is particulary worth protecting.

There are solutions, that can be combined with each other.

Pros:
- you are the owner of the data

Cons:
- more work than consuming just SAAS product
