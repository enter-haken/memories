# criticaly score

Many companies rely on open source software.
Some of these software is critical to running systems (e.g. fixing security bugs).

[criticaly score][1] calculates a number bettween `0` and `1` where 
`0` is **least-critical** and `1` is **most critcal**.

This repo is forced by google with the coal to financially support open source projects.
