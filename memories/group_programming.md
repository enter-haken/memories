Due to the Covid19 desease, software developers are send into home office. 
Since software development is not a single task any more (actually a fact for decades),
working together becomes more complicated.
Software vendors are creating colaboration functions in their products.
This leads to a kind of vendor lock in.
So if you want to use those features, all developers have to use the same dev environment.
But what if you want to use your own stack?

Similar to the the language server protocol, you can use a web view, where all changes from
every developer are shown.
