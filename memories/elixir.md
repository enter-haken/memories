# elixir

# ideas

* having mnesia as redis/memcache replacement in front of a PostgreSQL database

  * notify for entity change
  * backend pulls new entity into mnesia
  * automatically distribution to all nodes
  * fast serve time
  * suitable for data with a lot of cold storage
  * further read: [Why isnâ€™t mnesia the most preferred database for use in Elixir/Phoenix?][1]
