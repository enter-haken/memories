# special thanks

When you build software, you often rely on OSS.
To give these guys a kind of "special thanks", you can 

* checkout all `git repositories` you are using as a dependency
* get all `commiter names` from the repo
* build some kind of `movie credits` as a video (ffmepg kind of stuff?)

sounds cool
