When I went to university 23 years ago, 
you were connected to the internet with a 56k modem.
If you took a course, you rented books from a library, 
and spend a lot of money in the copy shop.

Nowadays information is cheap, and the frequency 
of gaining new information is very high. 

What is it worth remembering and what not.
Wow can you remember efficently?
How to forget irrelevant information?

I startet brain with the intention of

* adding memories with only a few steps
* connecting information with each other
  * maybe with machine learning / text mining.
* rate the connection
* find paths between information

My target is:

* use your brain before google
* insert a thought/memory before setting a bookmark
* share your brain with others
* have power over its own data
