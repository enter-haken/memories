When I went to university 23 years ago, 
you were connected to the internet with a 56k modem.
If you took a course, you rented books from a library, 
and spend a lot of money in the copy shop.

Nowadays information is cheap, and the frequency 
of gaining new information is very high. 

What is it worth remembering and what not.
Wow can you remember efficently?
How to forget irrelevant information?

I startet brain with the intention of

* adding memories with only a few steps
* connecting information with each other
  * maybe with machine learning / text mining.
* rate the connection
  * the memory get ranked by the count of links to it
* find paths between information

My target is:

* use your brain before google
* insert a thought/memory before setting a bookmark
* share your brain with others
* have power over its own data

## features

* client offline support?
* create links from all open tabs
* login with multiple accounts (home/work)
  * see a merged version of your brain
* feature / bug voting
  * logged on users can submit own ideas
  * logged on users can vote for ideas
  * every one can see feature / bug list 
* browser plugin to add new memories.
* only fat client?
* use dropbox / google drive as storage? 

From the business perspective:

* put stuff which could increase the traffic or the storage behind a paywall
* deep links for memories / share icons
  * public traffic
* save pdf for websites as well
  * storage costs
* save images / videos
  * storage costs
* autotagging 
  * TensorFlow model for each user? (CPU time/storage)

## selfhosted brain 

* docker container
* NAS support

### brain as a service 

* demo login?
* video tour
* free trial
* monthly / annually plan
