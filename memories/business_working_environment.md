# Working environment

When you work together with other people on a software project, you often find tools like

* [Jira][1] / [Confluence][2]
* [GitLab][3] or similar for extended source control
* [Jenkins][4] as a build / test / deploy server
* Continuous integration tools like [CircleCI][5]
* Tools for integration tests like the [robot framework][6].

for colaboration and team work.

Due to corona, these tools become more important, because more people work from home.
This work should be done asynchronously.
Teams can work around the globe in different time zones. 

The commercial part of these tools are becomming more and more cloud only with a subscribtion model. 
There is a danger loosing the control about your data.

Software development should be independent from other vendors. 
Software development should be free.
