# remote work

Since the beginning of the corona pandemic, remote working has become increasingly important.
From my perspective, remote work will become the new normal.

Working remotely is a little different than working on site. 
In order not to neglect the social component of work, new tools are needed.

Successfull remote work means:

* having working processes in place
* communication is asynchronous
  * especially, when having coworkers in different time zones around the globe
* no core working time
  * people agree on what needs to be done, not when
  * this can lead to a fragmented workday

# social components
 
Working remotely is no problem with the rigoht processes and tools .

It is more interesting, what is happening to us over time, not meeting someone in person.

Before the pandemic starts, you went to work, power on your workstation and grap some coffee or so.
When the first colleagues arrived, we usually did some small talk, or talk about today.

How to achieve this remotely?
