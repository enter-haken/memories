Since the beginning of the corona pandemic, remote working has become increasingly important.
From my perspective, remote work will become the new normal.

Working remotely is a little different than working on site. 
In order not to neglect the social component of work, new tools are needed.

Successfull remote work means:

* having working processes in place
* communication is asynchronous
  * especially, when having coworkers in different time zones around the globe
* no core working time
  * people agree on what needs to be done, not when
  * this can lead to a fragmented workday
