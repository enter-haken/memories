# pbok

In a few weeks, whatsapp won't work any more for me. 
If I'm honest to myself, I should have left the building years ago.
So, how can the future look like?

Currently I am using Wire and Matrix (element) in parallel.
Due to the massive power consumtion of background apps, some phones
send apps into sleep mode. This is not good for communication apps.
I open the Wire app from time to time, to see if messages have been arrived.
This is not optimal.

Element works quite fine, and I think it is an alternative to Whatsapp.

But if you were able to control your own data, would it be an even better alternative?

# What do you want to do?

When you think of your family and friends (not facebook friends), how big is your count?
50? 100? 150?

Not even close to [2,000,000,000][1] people, or?

So, what do you want? 
You want to talk to your `family` and `friends`, 
and you want to	`trust` this communication.

# Where to start?

Let's take a look forward, and let's imagine, that a new plattform is available.
On the first start, the owner decides, who can access the plattform, and sends
`invitation links` to the people. (per mail for example)

# The app

Once installed, the app generates a `uniqe identifier`. 

You can enter your `name`, if you like, but it is `not necessary`.
`You decide`, if your name will be displayed to other participants.

Personal data is `only stored on the device`.

When you click on the `invitation link`, 
your personal id and the id on the server will be linked.

From now on, you can communicate with other participants on the server.

# naming things

`pbok` is just a working title for now.
This is just short for `phone` and `book`. (bok? yes, just shorter ;) )
